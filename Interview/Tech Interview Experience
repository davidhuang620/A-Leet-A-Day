CRUD APP - Array 

Add - O(1)
Check if the item to add is a duplicate or not by using a hash table. Then add it in the hash table.

Deletion - O(1) if we know where the element is
Store the element as keys, and element index in array as values in the hash table. 
So when we want to delete an element, we know the index of the element.
Swap the last item with the element we want to delete, then pop the last item. (or decrease the array size by 1, lazy deletion)

Random Access - O(1)
Randomly generator a number in [0 , array.size), then use the random number as index to random access the array[random number].
Hash table - O(n)
